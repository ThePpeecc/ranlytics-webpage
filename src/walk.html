              <h3>The Problems</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>Walk tests of buildings, and of sites such as sports stadiums, public spaces, recreational facilities and outdoor malls has always been time-consuming and costly; and the tests necessary to prepare for, and confirm the successful installation of a DAS often delay the project.</p>
              <p>Legacy equipment is expensive and prone to faults, and equipment complexity means that tests have to be performed by experienced engineers.  Typically, 20% or more of walk tests performed today require a second site visit to collect data that wasn’t initially collected because of equipment issues.</p>
              <p>Post-processing of log files, and the subsequent manual and time-intensive collation of data and preparation of reports then consumes even more time and cost; whilst the burden on your skilled RF engineers to do this necessary but repetitive work both increases your costs and lowers team morale.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <h3>The RANlytics Solution</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>Cerno from RANlytics has been designed and built from the ground up to address each and every one of these issues and constraints. </p>
              <p>Using our custom-built and highly reliable Cerno RF testers we can walk test far more quickly and more frequently. Because Cerno is so scalable, we can test all operator/technology/band combinations in a single pass. And because Cerno is so robust and reliable, follow-up site visits to collect missing data are eliminated.  </p>
              <p>We immediately upload log files to our cloud for instantaneous post-processing, and fully-automated generation of management-quality reports in MS Word, complete with plots and tabulated results.  </p>
              <p>Our customers can immediately see and analyse the data through our web-based Cerno Workbench – within minutes of the walk test being completed.</p>
              <p>And because all data from all tests are always available, time-based change analysis is quick and easy – for the first time.</p>
